## 😇 Who is this course meant for?

- You want to get a stronger understanding of the Cadence smart contract language
- You want to learn more advanced Cadence patterns & concepts
- You have completed our <a href="https://github.com/emerald-dao/beginner-cadence-course" target="_blank">Beginner Cadence Course</a> and are looking for more

## 📚 How does it work?

The lessons will be split into "chapters," and chapters will be split into "days." I did it this way so you can manage your time and progress through the course as you like. Do not feel pressured to do this every day. Do it at your own pace and have fun with it! It will always be here :)

Here's an overview:
- Lessons split into days
- Written & video content associated with each day. The videos will be from my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf6DzMRwj7SJ3nPrZqd5hHw).
- Quests to complete
- A completion certificate (<a href="">this FLOAT</a>) if you have completed all the quests from Chapters 1-4. This will be proof that you have significant Cadence knowledge, and you will be able to show it to whoever you like as proof of expertise. Or just for fun! :D

## ❓ What do I need ahead of time?

The prerequisit for this course is that you are able to *understand* practically all Cadence code. This means being able to understand major concepts like resources, account storage, access control, and being able to digest all Cadence syntax.

If you're looking for a more direct answer, if you have completed our <a href="https://github.com/emerald-dao/beginner-cadence-course" target="_blank">Beginner Cadence Course</a>, then you are good to go.

## 📁 What are quests?

Quests are like homework assignments. There are quests for every day of content. They will test your understanding of the concepts that are in that day's content. 

## 🙋 How to Submit Quests

When you finish a quest, please store all your quests together. Then, when you want them to be reviewed, submit them in the #quest-submissions channel inside the [Emerald Academy Discord](https://discord.gg/wjA875sMjV) and our instructors will review them.

## 📝 Quizzes

Every day *also* has a quiz associated with it to test your knowledge. It is a simple Google Form you can fill out to test your understanding for that day's content.

*All of these quizzes are entirely thanks to FrankenSense. Thank you for being an absolute legend!*

## 🇺🇸 Multilingual Support

This course is currently available in English (README.md), Chinese (README_ZH.md), Spanish (README_ES.md), and Russian (README_RU.md). Under each day of content, you will see a matching README file for your language of choice.
